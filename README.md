2Market - Exploratory analysis and presenting insights

Project Summary: The first six week LSE project involved a fictional situation I helped 2Market, a leading international supermarket chain, leverage data analytics to gain deeper customer understanding to boost sales. By analysing consumer datasets, I uncovered valuable insights into customer behaviour, sales trends, and advertising effectiveness.

The business problem I identified centres oround the marketing team struggling to generate adequate new business growth due to uncertainty around customer demographics and advertising

This report considered the following main questions:

“Who are the customers?”
“How effective have current ad strategies been?”
“How do customers interact with products?”


Analytical Approach Highlights:

Cleaned and Pre-processed Data: Ensured data quality by meticulously identifying and addressing inconsistencies, improving database interactions, and guaranteeing completeness. There were particular issues with data types and the presence of outliers.
SQL Analysis: Utilised SQL to conduct in-depth analyses, including total spend per country, demographic-based product popularity, and advertising platform performance. These insights revealed hidden patterns for informed decision-making.
Actionable Dashboards: Designed user-friendly dashboards segmented by demographics, advertising and product interactions. These dashboards followed WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) guidelines for accessibility, allowing stakeholders to easily grasp key findings. These can be found below.
Strategic Recommendations: Delivered actionable insights with a direct impact on 2Market's strategy. This included optimising advertising spend, tailoring marketing for specific demographics, and adjusting product categories based on customer preferences.
